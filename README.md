# "Dice" program

This is a simple program to generate dice.  I used a variant of this in my Lua 6dice game.  Mostly this was just to see how to generate a random sequence of numbers, all the numbers in a set.  By changing the total numbers in the set, you can see how long it takes to converge.  Convergence is filling all the numbers in the set in a random order.

The default set is 6, but any number can be used.
